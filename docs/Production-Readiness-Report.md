# Production Readiness Report

## Executive Summary
- Introduced centralized logger with runtime redaction and replaced direct `console` calls across client and server modules.
- Added CI scripts for linting, type checking, build, dependency audit, bundle size, and sensitive data scanning.
- Removed unused `cors` and `express` dependencies and enforced `NODE_ENV=production` in build and start scripts.
- Fixed minor lint issues such as unused imports and variables.

## Risk Register
| Area | Description | Recommendation | Effort |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| TypeScript errors | `pnpm typecheck` reports missing types and invalid properties in several components (e.g., `components/totals-panel.tsx`). | Align types with implementations or remove stale code. | Medium |
| Next.js config disables checks | `next.config.mjs` ignores ESLint and TypeScript errors during build. | Remove `ignoreDuringBuilds` and `ignoreBuildErrors` for stricter builds. | Low |
| Sensitive string scan | `pnpm sensitive-scan` flags numerous matches including tokens and vendor names in source. | Review flagged files and move any true secrets to server-only env vars. | Medium |
| Security headers & CORS | No explicit hardening of CSP, X-Content-Type-Options, Referrer-Policy, COOP/COEP, CORP, or CORS origin restrictions. | Implement appropriate headers and restrict CORS to known origins. | Medium |
| Missing rate limiting / input validation | Public API routes lack rate limiting and schema validation beyond basic checks. | Add validation middleware (e.g., zod) and rate limiting. | Medium |

## Checklist
| Check | Result |
| --- | --- |
| `pnpm lint` | Pass with warnings |
| `pnpm typecheck` | Fail |
| `pnpm build` | Pass (with dummy env vars) |
| `pnpm depcheck` | Pass (unused deps reported) |
| `pnpm bundle-size` | Pass |
| `pnpm sensitive-scan` | Fail |
